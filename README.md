# ChatIT ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-16.13.1-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=oceanBlue)

ChatIT is a Q&A platform for business meetings and events, but it works great for chats
between friends as well. It offers an interactive Q&A and gives you some information about
your audience. If you need to host a meeting online, ChatIT is here to help you make it
interactive. The platform makes it easy to engage with your audience, whether you run a
large video conference, a small team meeting, or you just want to ask your friends a
question. Because in the end, the important thing is everyone to become part of the conversation.
